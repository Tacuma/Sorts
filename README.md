Data Structures/Concepts Used:
==============================
Vector, Functions, File I/O, Queues, Heap


Description
===========
You are asked to create a vector of 1,000 random integers (all < 10,000) and to save them in an output file.  
Use vectors and iteractors thoughout your code. Your program can use the following code to generate a random number between 1 and 10,000.
The resulting file of random integers should contain no duplicates.  

(1)Bubble Sort program in C++ to sort the 1,000 random unique numbers
(2)Selection Sort program in C++ to sort the 1,000 random unique numbers
(3)Insertion Sort program in C++ to sort the 1,000 random unique numbers
(4)Merge Sort program in C++ to sort the 1,000 random unique numbers
(5)Quick Sort program in C++ to sort the 1,000 random unique numbers
(6)Heap Sort program in C++ to sort the 1,000 random unique numbers
(7)Radix Sort program in C++ to sort the 1,000 random unique numbers
