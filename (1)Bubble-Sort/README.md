Bubble Sort
===========


Data Structures/Concepts Used:
==============================
Vector, Functions, File I/O


Description:
============
You are asked to create a vector of 1,000 random integers (all < 10,000) and to save them in an output file.  
Use vectors and iteractors thoughout your code. Your program can use the following code to generate a random number between 1 and 10,000.
The resulting file of random integers should contain no duplicates.  

Please write a Bubble sort program in C++ to sort the 1,000 random unique numbers


Output
======
Sorted integers are in output.txt.

Bubble Sort complete.
